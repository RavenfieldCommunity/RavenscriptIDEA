---Any value
---@alias DynValue any
---Integer
---@alias int integer

---@alias float number
---Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer. (RangeÔºö0 to 18446744073709551615)

---@class Behaviours: ScriptedBehaviour
---The ScriptedBehaviour component in which the Ravenscript is executed.
---@field script ScriptedBehaviour
---A Lua table with references to other Unity objects such as GameObjects, Transforms, and prefabs. These targets are assigned and named in the Unity Editor.
---@field targets GameObject[]
---The script‚Äôs GameObject. Use primary to access the GetComponent() method.
---@field gameObject GameObject
---The GameObject‚Äôs Transform. Used to translate, orient, and scale the object.
---@field transform Transform
---Called once when the Ravenscript component is instantiated. Use `Awake()` to store references to other Ravenscripts and Components. Use `Awake()` for setup and initialization of internal variables.
---`Awake()` is called prior to `Start()`. `Awake()` is called if-and-only-if its GameObject is active.
---@field Awake function
---Called once every frame. The bulk of all game logic goes here.
---`Update()` is called after `Start()`. Update() is called if-and-only-if its GameObject is active and enabled.
---@field Update function
---Called once when the Ravenscript component is instantiated. It should be safe to interact with other components and scripts which references you gathered in `Awake()`.
---`Start()` is called after `Awake()`. `Start()` is called if-and-only-if its GameObject is active.
---Many developer use `Start()` exclusively and ignore `Awake()`. Reserving the use of `Awake()` solely to solve order dependent initialization problems.
